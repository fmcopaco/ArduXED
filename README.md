## ArduXED

ArduXED (Arduino Xpressnet Einfacher Drehregler) was born from the idea of having an additional remote control for controlling locomotives with minimal functionality similar to FREMO's existing FRED remote control for Loconet, but for the Xpressnet bus.

It's ideal for leaving for our guests or young enthusiasts so they can control a single train on our model. The remote control only has a potentiometer for controlling the locomotive's speed, a switch for selecting the direction of travel, and a button to activate a function. 

Only requires adding an Arduino, a diode, and a MAX485 as an interface to the Xpressnet bus.
